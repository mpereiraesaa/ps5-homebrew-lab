 * PS5 platform half of gate 0.2a.

 * Descriptor installation goes through `sysarch(I386_SET_LDT, ...)`, which
 * FreeBSD amd64 implements as `amd64_set_ldt`. The pinned payload SDK
 * declares it, but a declaration is not a capability: this firmware may
 * have removed local-descriptor-table support or filtered `sysarch` down to
 * the fsbase/gsbase operations an ordinary title needs. Measuring that is
 * the whole point of the gate.
 *
 * The pages are reserved low and separately, one writable and one made
 * executable afterwards, so the probe never asks for memory that is
 * writable and executable at once.
