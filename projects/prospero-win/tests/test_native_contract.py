"""Static contract for the loader core and the PS5 adapter.

The adapter cannot be compiled by `make test`: it needs the pinned Prospero
toolchain. These checks therefore hold the properties that a host compiler
would not catch anyway, and that the porting playbook says decide whether a
port survives its first boot.

The central rule is principle 1: on this firmware a platform symbol that is
merely exported is not a working one. The loader core is written to import
almost nothing, and the calls the adapter does depend on are the ones the
laboratory has already measured, each covered by a boot-time smoke test.
